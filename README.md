# DepreCity

**The True Cost of Ownership.**

DepreCity is a specialized valuation tool for townhouses in Coquitlam and Port Moody, BC. Unlike standard real estate calculators that focus on price-per-square-foot, DepreCity uses a "Discount Function" to account for the non-linear "S-curve" of value, specific risk eras (like the Leaky Condo Crisis), and land value floors.

## Features

*   **Valuation Calculator:** Inputs for unit size, year built, market benchmarks, and specific risks (strata fees, levies, rainscreen status).
*   **Depreciation Visualizer:** A chart demonstrating the non-linear depreciation curve specific to the Tri-Cities market.
*   **Educational Report:** A comprehensive breakdown of construction eras ("Geologic Layers") and the physics of depreciation.
